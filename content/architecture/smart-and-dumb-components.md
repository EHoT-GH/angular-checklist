### Smart and Dumb Components

Every major frontend framework nowadays is moving towards a component based architecture. Components are a combination of a little bit of html, javascript and css. This way of working can provide us with a lot of benefits if used in the correct way.

The most advocated way to use them is through smart and dumb components (there is a variety of other names as well but the general principle is the same). 

#### Component types

A dumb component:

- Gets data through `@Input`s and communicates only with it's direct parent through `@Output`s. 
- It does not know about the rest of the application. It is dumb and does not know where it is being used.
- Can contain business logic, but only logic that belongs to the scope of this component. A paging component can contain the logic to calculate the number of 'boxes' to show. It does not know what happens when a user clicks a page number. In that case, it throws a custom events to tell the page is clicked and the parent component decides what happens.
- It can use other dumb components as children.
- It can inject services that are related to the view layer of your application (think `TranslateService`, `Router`, ...) but never services to fetch its own data.

A smart component:

- Knows about the application and will fetch data.
- It passes data down to dumb components as much as possible and mostly only contains the business logic to fetch the data.
- It is build up out of several dumb components.
- It listen for events thrown by the dumb components and performs the required action for them. 

#### Benefits

- Dumb components are completely reusable since they have a defined API and are not linked to any specific services of data calls.
- Dumb components are easy to test as they are completely isolated.
- The entire architecture of your components becomes easier to reason about. If there is a business logic or data fetching problem, you know that you need to start searching in the smart component. Since that is the responsability of that component.
