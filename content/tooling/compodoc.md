# Problem

On boarding of new developers in your project can be quite difficult. Especially if the applications are getting bigger and bigger. 

And when the project is getting really big, even for developers that have been working on it for a long time, keeping an overview can become hard. 

# Solution

Documentation for our code is the solution to these problems. Of course, everyone knows that writing documentation is hard, boring and the documentation itself gets out of date quite quickly. 

We can however use compodoc to generate documentation from our code. This means that it doesn't take any time to write and it can never get out of date as it is generated from the existing code at all times.
