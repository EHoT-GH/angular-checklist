## Slogan


## Key selling points

The Angular checklist is a curated list of common mistakes made inside of Angular applications. Through our experience coaching Angular developers and auditing multiple Angular codebases, we found that we were often repeating the same points. The Angular checklist will hold these points and provide you with the option to check of all points for your own application! 

It will remember the checks you've made before which allows you to gruadually refactor parts of your application. Everytime new entries are made to the checklist, they will be visualised so you can use the Angular checklist as a way to stay up to date with future versions as well!
